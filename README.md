## 💤 Moodream — AI Dream & Mood Journal with Runner H

Hi everyone! I'm Vida from Iran 🇮🇷  
This is my submission for the Runner H AI Prompting Challenge 🧠

### ✨ What is Moodream?

**Moodream** is a personal project designed to help users record and analyze their dreams and moods using AI, bridging the worlds of subconscious experiences and emotional well-being.  

Currently, it supports:  
- 🧠 Daily dream journaling via text input  
- 💖 Basic emotional tone detection using sentiment analysis  
- 🗂️ Categorization of dream types (e.g., nightmares, recurring dreams)  
- 📈 Generation of simple monthly reports summarizing dream patterns and moods  

---

### 🧠 How Runner H powers Moodream:

- Prompts users daily to share their dream descriptions  
- Extracts key themes and symbols using NLP techniques  
- Analyzes emotional tones like fear, joy, anxiety, or longing  
- Classifies dreams by type through clustering and keyword analysis  
- Tracks mood trends over time with visual reports  

---

### 🌈 Example Prompt for Runner H:

> “User describes last night’s dream:  
> ‘I was flying over a purple sea and met an old friend.’  
> Analyze and store this dream. Detect mood. Classify type. Add to journal.”
