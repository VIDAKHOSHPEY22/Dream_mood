## 💤 About Moodream

Hi everyone! I'm **Vida** from Iran 🇮🇷  
This is my submission for the **Runner H AI Prompting Challenge** 🧠

**Moodream** is an emotional self-tracking tool that transforms your dreams into data, insights, and personal growth.  
Built with 💡 creativity, ❤️ empathy, and the power of **Runner H**, it helps you:

- Record and reflect on your dreams  
- Detect emotions and psychological patterns  
- Analyze dream types and mental states  
- Generate visual mood and dream reports

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Dream Journal**: Log daily dreams through text input  
- 💖 **Emotion Detection**: Analyze mood tones (e.g. joy, anxiety, longing) using NLP  
- 🗂️ **Dream Classification**: Categorize dreams (nightmare, recurring, symbolic, lucid)  
- 📈 **Monthly Reports**: Track trends in mood, frequency, and emotional state  

---

## 🧠 Runner H in Action

Runner H plays a key role in:

- Prompting dream input each day  
- Extracting key symbols and emotional signals  
- Analyzing text with sentiment and context  
- Clustering dreams and identifying themes  
- Generating smart reports and visualizations  

---

## 🌈 Sample Runner H Prompt

> “User describes last night’s dream:  
> ‘I was walking through fog and a white owl whispered: You are not lost.’  
> Analyze content. Detect mood. Classify dream type. Store in journal.”

---

## 📊 Example Monthly Report

> - Dreams logged: 12  
> - Nightmares: 2  
> - Recurring dreams: 3  
> - Dominant emotion: **longing**  
> - Mood trend: 🔻 in early days, 🔼 after day 20  
> - Suggested tip: Try reflective journaling or sleep meditation 🧘‍♀️  

---

## 🔮 Future Development & Vision

Moodream is just the beginning. Here's what’s next:

- 🎙️ **Voice input** for faster, more natural dream logging  
- 🤖 **Transformer-based emotion analysis** for deeper understanding  
- 📱 **Responsive UI** with graphs, mood wheels, and filters  
- 🧾 **Psychological Feedback** based on behavior & dream patterns  
- ☁️ **Cloud syncing** for multi-device journaling  
- 🧘 **Habit tools**: Sleep reminders, daily affirmations  

---

### 🧩 Personality Insights (Concept)

In the future, Moodream will offer **AI-based personality analysis** by:

- Detecting subconscious traits in dreams  
- Revealing recurring emotional or behavioral patterns  
- Providing growth suggestions using psychological models (Big Five, Jungian, CBT-inspired)  
- Helping users track inner conflicts, resilience, and creativity  

This concept adds a unique, **psychologically enriched dimension** to Moodream — making it not just a journal, but a **mirror to the soul**.

# 🏆 Runner H AI Agent Prompting Challenge Submission  
**👩‍💻 Developer:** Vida Khoshpey  
**📍 Location:** Iran  
**📅 Submission Date:** 2025-06-13

---

## 🕊️ A Personal Note on Barriers, Hope, and AI

As a developer based in Iran, I live and work under difficult circumstances that affect nearly every aspect of my access to technology:

- 💥 **Ongoing war and conflict** create instability and unpredictable power/internet outages.
- 🌐 **International sanctions** restrict access to many platforms — including the official [Runner H](https://runnerh.com) interface.
- 🔒 **Bandwidth throttling** and censorship make it nearly impossible to download packages or explore AI services.

But I refused to let these limitations extinguish my creativity or desire to participate in this global movement.

---

## 💡 My Submission: *Moodream Pro Advanced*

Since I couldn’t access Runner H directly, I simulated its philosophy by creating a **local AI agent** with offline capabilities.

**Moodream Pro Advanced** is a Streamlit-based app that helps users **log their dreams**, receive **mood analysis**, and get **well-being suggestions** — all in an automated and empathic way.

### 🌟 Key Features:
- 🛌 Dream entry with timestamp & sentiment analysis  
- 🌈 Emotion classification based on dream content  
- 🔁 Detection of recurring stressors or symbols  
- 📊 Visual mood trends and exportable CSV reports  
- 💬 Friendly summaries with personalized mental wellness tips  

All of this happens autonomously — **no prompts, no technical input** needed from the user.

---

## 🤖 Prompt I Would Have Used Inside Runner H

If I had access to the Runner H platform, this is the **exact and actionable prompt** I would provide to automate the full dream mood analysis experience:

---

**Prompt:**

You're an autonomous AI wellness assistant. Your task is to help users log their dreams and provide them with emotional insights and daily wellness feedback.

### 🛠️ Steps:

1. Open a user-friendly input interface for submitting dreams (plain text).
2. Use NLP-based sentiment and emotion analysis to determine the emotional tone (e.g., joy, fear, anxiety, sadness).
3. Detect recurring symbols, keywords, or emotional patterns across entries.
4. Visualize mood trends over time (daily/weekly) with charts.
5. Provide empathetic, human-like summaries and suggestions for mental well-being based on analysis.
6. Automatically generate and export a daily CSV report with mood tags, emotional summaries, and dream metadata.
7. Make the system fully autonomous: no coding, no commands — just natural interaction.

---

**Tone:** Supportive, gentle, and human-centered.  
**Output:** Clear, helpful, and formatted insight the user can emotionally connect with.

---

## 🎥 How I Will Showcase It

Due to the geopolitical and digital constraints I face:

- I could **not register or interact** with the Runner H agent directly.
- I was **unable to record a video demonstration** of the official product.

## 🧩 Instead, I Will Share:

Due to sanctions and internet restrictions, I was unable to access the official Runner H platform or use OpenAI services to run autonomous AI agents online.

Instead, I have written a detailed prompt that I would have used with Runner H, and developed my own Python-based local AI assistant to demonstrate the core functionalities.

My Streamlit app runs completely offline, allowing me to showcase an AI-powered wellness assistant — even without access to Runner H or any cloud AI platforms.

I am sharing:

- 📄 The exact prompt I designed for Runner H to automate the task  
- 💻 Full source code of my local Python app demonstrating the AI assistant  
- 🖼️ Screenshots and video demos of my app working offline, highlighting its capabilities despite connectivity and access limitations  

This project shows my creativity and perseverance in building meaningful AI tools under difficult circumstances.


---

## ❤️ Final Words

I didn’t just join this challenge to code.  
I joined to **hope**, to connect, and to show that **innovation can rise even in the most constrained environments**.

In a world where some are blocked from using global tools, it’s vital we create agents that are inclusive, accessible, and resilient.

**Runner H** gave me a spark.  
I turned that spark into something real — offline, yes — but full of heart.

Thank you for hearing my voice through this submission.  
Let’s build a world where **no one is left behind** in the AI revolution.

**— Vida Khoshpey**
