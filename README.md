## 💤 About Moodream

Hi everyone! I'm **Vida** from Iran 🇮🇷  
This is my submission for the **Runner H AI Prompting Challenge** 🧠

**Moodream** is an emotional self-tracking tool that transforms your dreams into data, insights, and personal growth.  
Built with 💡 creativity, ❤️ empathy, and the power of **Runner H**, it helps you:

- Record and reflect on your dreams  
- Detect emotions and psychological patterns  
- Analyze dream types and mental states  
- Generate visual mood and dream reports

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Dream Journal**: Log daily dreams through text input  
- 💖 **Emotion Detection**: Analyze mood tones (e.g. joy, anxiety, longing) using NLP  
- 🗂️ **Dream Classification**: Categorize dreams (nightmare, recurring, symbolic, lucid)  
- 📈 **Monthly Reports**: Track trends in mood, frequency, and emotional state  

---

## 🌈 Sample Runner H Prompt

> “User describes last night’s dream:

## 🔮 Future Development & Vision

Moodream is just the beginning. Here's what’s next:

- 🎙️ **Voice input** for faster, more natural dream logging  
- 🤖 **Transformer-based emotion analysis** for deeper understanding  
- 📱 **Responsive UI** with graphs, mood wheels, and filters  
- 🧾 **Psychological Feedback** based on behavior & dream patterns  
- ☁️ **Cloud syncing** for multi-device journaling  
- 🧘 **Habit tools**: Sleep reminders, daily affirmations

### 🧩 Personality Insights (Concept)

In the future, Moodream will offer **AI-based personality analysis** by:

- Detecting subconscious traits in dreams  
- Revealing recurring emotional or behavioral patterns  
- Providing growth suggestions using psychological models (Big Five, Jungian, CBT-inspired)  
- Helping users track inner conflicts, resilience, and creativity  

This concept adds a unique, **psychologically enriched dimension** to Moodream — making it not just a journal, but a **mirror to the soul**.
